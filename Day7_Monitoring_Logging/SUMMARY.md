## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Linux/Mac
cd Day7_Monitoring_Logging
./deploy.sh

# Windows PowerShell
cd Day7_Monitoring_Logging
.\deploy.ps1
```

### Manual Setup
1. Build the application: `docker build -t sample-app:latest .`
2. Install monitoring stack via Helm
3. Deploy application and monitoring components
4. Access Grafana and explore dashboards

## 📊 What You'll Monitor

### Application Metrics
- **Request Rate** - Requests per second by endpoint
- **Latency** - Response times (50th and 95th percentiles)
- **Error Rate** - Error counts by type
- **Active Requests** - Currently processing requests
- **HTTP Status Codes** - Distribution of response codes

### Infrastructure Metrics
- **Pod CPU Usage** - CPU consumption per pod
- **Pod Memory Usage** - Memory consumption per pod
- **Node Metrics** - Cluster-wide resource usage
- **Kubernetes Metrics** - Pod status, deployments, services

### Logs
- **Application Logs** - Structured JSON logs
- **Kubernetes Logs** - Container and pod logs
- **System Logs** - Node and cluster logs

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Prometheus Integration
- Custom metrics exposed via `/metrics` endpoint
- ServiceMonitor for automatic discovery
- PromQL queries for advanced analytics

### ✅ Grafana Dashboards
- Pre-built custom dashboard for the sample app
- Kubernetes cluster overview
- Real-time metrics visualization
- Log exploration with Loki

### ✅ Load Testing
- Multiple test scenarios (load, stress, error, latency)
- Automated traffic generation
- Performance benchmarking
- Cross-platform scripts (bash and PowerShell)

### ✅ Health Monitoring
- Liveness and readiness probes
- Health check endpoints
- Automatic pod restart on failures
- Resource limits and requests

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Adding Custom Metrics
```python
# In your application
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

# Define custom metrics
CUSTOM_METRIC = Counter('my_custom_metric', 'Description')
BUSINESS_METRIC = Gauge('business_value', 'Business metric')
```

### Creating Custom Dashboards
1. Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000
2. Create new dashboard
3. Add panels with PromQL queries
4. Save and share dashboard

### Setting Up Alerts
```yaml
# Example alert rule
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: sample-app-alerts
spec:
  groups:
  - name: sample-app
    rules:
    - alert: HighErrorRate
      expr: rate(app_error_total[5m]) > 0.1
      for: 1m
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Load Testing Scenarios
1. **Normal Load** - Simulate regular traffic patterns
2. **Stress Test** - High load to test limits
3. **Error Test** - Generate errors to test monitoring
4. **Latency Test** - Measure response times

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Test metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics

# Generate traffic
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl http://localhost:8080/api/data
  sleep 0.1
done
```

## 📈 Monitoring Best Practices

### 1. Metrics Design
- Use meaningful metric names
- Include appropriate labels
- Document your metrics
- Follow naming conventions

### 2. Dashboard Design
- Keep dashboards focused and relevant
- Use appropriate visualization types
- Include time ranges and refresh rates
- Add descriptions and documentation

### 3. Alerting Strategy
- Set realistic thresholds
- Use appropriate alert durations
- Include meaningful alert messages
- Test your alerts regularly

### 4. Log Management
- Use structured logging (JSON)
- Include correlation IDs
- Set appropriate log levels
- Implement log rotation

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. No Metrics Showing
- Check if ServiceMonitor is configured correctly
- Verify Prometheus targets are up
- Ensure application exposes `/metrics` endpoint
- Check network policies and service mesh

#### 2. Grafana Not Accessible
- Verify pods are running in monitoring namespace
- Check port-forward is working
- Ensure correct credentials (admin/prom-operator)
- Check firewall and network settings

#### 3. High Resource Usage
- Adjust Prometheus retention settings
- Optimize scrape intervals
- Use recording rules for expensive queries
- Consider horizontal scaling

#### 4. Logs Not Appearing
- Verify Loki is running and accessible
- Check log shipping configuration
- Ensure proper log format
- Verify network connectivity
